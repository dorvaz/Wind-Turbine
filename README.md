## Context

In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's like wind speed, wind direction, 
generated power etc. for 10 minutes intervals. This file was taken from a wind turbine's 
scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey.

## Content

The data's in the file are:

*	**Date/Time**: (for 10 minutes intervals).
*	**LV ActivePower (kW)**: The power generated by the turbine for that moment.
*	**Wind Speed (m/s)**: The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
*	**TheoreticalPowerCurve (KWh)**: The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer.
*	**Wind Direction (°)**: The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly).

## Problem definition

The objective of this kernel is the prediction of the energy produced by a wind turbine. For this estimation, we use the data provided in the dataset: wind speed and direction, generated power, and theoretical power that should produce (data provided by the manufacturer).

This is a supervised learning problem, since they provide us with the target variable.
It should be noted that they do not provide us with some relevant data, such as: location, temperature, humidity, rain, air density, technical stops, breakdowns...


## Used packages:

* **numpy:** A library adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* **pandas:** A fast, powerful, flexible and easy-to-use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
* **os:** The OS module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality. The functions that the OS module provides allows you to interface with the underlying operating system that Python is running on – be that Windows, Mac or Linux.
* **warnings:** Python programmers issue warnings by calling the warn() function defined in this module. 
* **time:** The Python time module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.
* **datetime:** The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation. For related functionality, see also the time and calendar modules.
* **scipy:** Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
* **sklearn:** is a free machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours, and it also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy .
* **xgboost:** open source library providing a hight-performance implementation of gradient boosted decision trees.
* **lightgbm:** is a gradient enhancement framework that uses a tree-based learning algorithm. Light GBM grows tree vertically while another algorithm grows tree horizontally, which means that Light GBM grows tree in leaf form while another algorithm grows in level. It will choose the leaf with the maximum delta loss to grow. By growing the same leaf, the smart leaf algorithm can reduce more losses than a smart level algorithm.
* **tensorflow:** It is an open source artificial intelligence library, using data flow graphs to build models. It allows developers to create large-scale neural networks with many layers. TensorFlow is mainly used for: Classification, Perception, Understanding, Discovering, Prediction and Creation.

* **matplotlib:** A Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. 
* **seaborn:** statistical data visualization. Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. For a brief introduction to the ideas behind the library, you can read the introductory notes.
* **windrose:** graphic tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location. It can also be used to describe air quality pollution sources.


## Features
Regardless of the features provided in the dataset, we can create others:

**suitable wind speed:** Wind turbines start operating when the wind reaches a speed of 3 to 4 meters per second, and reaches maximum electricity production with a wind of about 13 to 14 meters per second. If the wind is very strong, for example 25 meters per second as average speed for 10 minutes, the wind turbines stop for safety reasons.

**loss:** difference between the Teorical Powercurve and ActivePower.
